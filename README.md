- 👋 Hi, I’m @askarmel (Sophie)
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and AI 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deploy Machine Learning at scale (traditional ML, deep learning models, realtime inference & big data, security and onshore/offshore models, monitoring and continuous learning, ...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative approaches that help to keep things simple, maintainable and cost effective. I am also happy to support Women in ML.
- 📫 How to reach me: code contributions, twitter, email, MLOps community on Slack (@askarmel)
